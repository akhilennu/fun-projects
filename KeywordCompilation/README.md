#Keyword Compilation 

This project needs a video file, a subtitle file and a keyword.

All the subtitles that contain the keyword will be collected and the start and end time of that subtitle will be collected.
This start and end time will be used to extract a clip from the video that contains the video.

Compilation of all the clips in the video file that contain the keyword will be created and exported as a video.
